If you want to use this tool, you need to make sure you have Python 3.11 installed on your computer and available in cmd.

You can start the programs one by one in the order of (1) to (3).

If you already have version 3.11 on your computer but still cannot start (2) run_calibration and (3) run_main, you need to make sure you have added Python to the Path in the System Variables in the "Environment Variables" of your computer. The path of 3.11 and its Script script path 
(eg. C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311 
And C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts)
